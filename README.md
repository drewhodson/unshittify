# Unshittify

A set of resources to help unshittify your experience on the internet.

## Introduction

Inspired by Cory Doctorow's talk [An Audacious Plan to Halt the Internet's Enshittification](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rimtaSgGz_4)
as well as the rise of AI slop content, this repository seeks to catalogue resources
designed to aid in the <i>un</i>shittification of your experience on the internet.

Generally, resources belong here if they:

- Contain content created by real humans
- Respect your autonomy as an end user
- Do not attempt to hijack your attention span (i.e. no clickbait and no infinite algorithmic feeds)
- Have content which is enriching rather than distracting
